<!--Week 5 Assignment 4.1. Nicole Salow. October 2, 2021.
Output: A table of the numbers for 5 to 15 and their squares and cubes, using alert.
The author states to use the alert(string) function to output the table.  It is not possible to format the alert dialog by including HTML in it.  The author does not mean place the HTML in the alert dialog so the alert shows a table.

For your homework, you can do one of two things

You can use alert(string) 10 times to output the number and its square, as in
alert(n1 + " squared is " + n1squared");
alert(n2 + " squared is " + n2squared");

Just make sure you are using either the Math.pow(base, function) method or doing the calculation to find the square.
var n1 = 3;
var n1squared = n1 * n1;


You can ignore the alert call completely and simply output the table to the HTML page.  This will require you to use document.write(string) to write the complete table.  The example in section 4.6.3, borders.js, shows you how this can be done.
document.write("<table>");
document.write("<tr><th>Number</th><th>Number Squared</th></tr>");
document.write("<tr><td>" + n1 + "</td><td>" + n1squared + "</td></tr>"); -->
