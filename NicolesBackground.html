    <p><h1>More About Nicole</h1>
        <p>I am originally from a small town - Earlville, Iowa. Population ~800. <br/>
            I love to travel, but most people don't even know where Iowa is, let alone Earlville. So I ask them if they have ever heard of the Field of Dreams...that's where I'm from! The movie set is 
            only 10 minutes away in the neighboring town of Dyersville, which is where I went to high school and spent most of my time. Most people know the movie, so it gives them some idea of where I came from. <br/>
           </p>
           <p> After high school I went on to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, where I studied Journalism and Mass Communication with a focus on Magazine Journalism. Eventually I added Graphic Design
            as a second major, and loved it. I considered dropping Journalism all together, but my advisor told me of a dual degree program at Drake - I could graduate with TWO B.A. degrees if I stuck with it.
            Since Drake let you take major-related courses starting your freshman year, I already had many journalism classes under my belt, so I stuck it out. To this day I'm still unsure how I managed several jobs
            and two majors, but I graduated in the alloted four years! </p>
            <p>
            While at Drake I studied abroad with a program called Semester at Sea. It changed my life - the most amazing thing I've ever done! I traveled around the world (literally) on a ship called the MV 
            Explorer, with about 600 other students from all over the world. We stopped at many different ports - 11 countries total. I met a life-long best friend, and sparked my love of travel. I went on to graduate
            from Drake and move to South Korea for the next 5 years. I taught English at 4 different schools while there, and loved it. I even adopted my dog, Luca while there, and brought her back to the USA. I go back to visit every few years. <br/>
            <p>After Korea I moved back to Dubuque, Iowa (near my hometown) and worked for Boyd Gaming as a graphic designer. I now live in Joliet, Illinois with my boyfriend, Lucas and my dog. I work at the University of St. Francis as the one and only graphic desisgner.It's great to be back on a college campus, and it makes me miss
            those days - to an extent!
